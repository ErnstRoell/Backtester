# Backtester
This project is an event driven backtesting system for backtesting trading strategies using python. 
This program is inspired by the article series on Quantstart, see <https://www.quantstart.com/articles>, where parts of the code can be found. 
The majority of this code is a heavy edited version of the code there. 
The backtester is packaged as a library that can be installed on your local machine and it is adviced to this in development mode as the code at this stage is under my active developmet and there is no guarantee that it actually works now. 
In the folder tests all unittests are included.

# Installation

# Usage 
The requirements for the package to work are a mySQL server with the server setup as described in [this article](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Securities-Master-Database-with-MySQL-and-Python).
